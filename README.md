* Overview

The Transport Management System was developed using Microsoft PowerApps to streamline and digitalize the internal transport request process within the organization. The system allows employees to submit transport requests, enables supervisors to review and approve them, and provides administrators with tools to assign vehicles (office vehicles or approved taxis). The solution improves visibility, reduces manual follow-ups, and enhances cost tracking for each transport request over a selected period.

* Key Features

1. Transport Request Submission

Employees can create new transport requests with details such as date, time, destination, purpose, and passenger count.

Auto-notification to the relevant supervisor for approval.

2. Supervisor Approval Workflow

Supervisors can approve or reject requests directly from their dashboard.

Real-time status updates to users.

3. Admin Transport Assignment

Admins can assign an office vehicle or taxi based on availability.

View pending requests and vehicle schedules.

Maintain records of taxi charges and trip costs.

4. Cost Tracking & Reporting

Track the total transport cost for any selected period.

Maintain detailed logs of office vehicle usage and taxi expenses.

Helps management analyze transport spending and optimize resources.

5. User-Friendly Dashboards

Role-based dashboards (User, Supervisor, Admin).

Quick view of pending requests, approved trips, and cost summaries.

Challenges

1. Frequent Requirement Changes
The client often changed workflow requirements during development, which caused misalignment and rework.

Solution:
Conducted detailed discussions and clarified expected outcomes. Converted requirements into documented user stories and confirmed with stakeholders before implementation. This minimized change requests and ensured the final solution matched their needs.

2. Maintaining Data Accuracy
Ensuring every transport request had the correct approval trail and cost information.

Solution:
Used validation rules and automated flow checks to avoid missing or incorrect data inputs.


Microsoft PowerApps – App development and UI.

Power Automate – Approval workflow automation/ notifications  and report upload.

SharePoint Lists / Excel – data storage.
